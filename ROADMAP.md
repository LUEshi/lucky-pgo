# Lucky PGO Roadmap

## In Progress / Next
- Event alerts for upcoming events that include Pokemon still missing lucky status.
- Trade planner mode for marking targets and tracking completed trades in a session.
- Daily diff view ("what changed since yesterday") using `public/history` snapshots.

## Done
- **Partner dex overlay** - shipped partner lucky dex storage/import, partner-aware scoring, and "Both need" / "Partner only" badges on Trade Next cards. Design doc: [`docs/partner-dex-overlay.md`](docs/partner-dex-overlay.md).
- Partner dex import validation and UX safeguards for mismatched or stale payloads.
- Shared Missing Lucky Dex now excludes mythicals (not tradeable) and has quick-copy buttons for Non-Legendary and Legendary dex-number lists.

## Later
- Browser notifications when relevant raid/event/rocket targets appear.
- Event detail summaries with short human-readable highlights.
- Additional share state parameters (selected Pokemon and advanced filters).

## Notes
- History snapshots are generated by GitHub Actions and pruned to a 7-day window.
- Shared links can carry the full lucky dex state via compressed bitset (`dex` query param).
