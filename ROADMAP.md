# Lucky PGO Roadmap

## In Progress / Next
- Event alerts for upcoming events that include Pokemon still missing lucky status.
- Trade planner mode for marking targets and tracking completed trades in a session.
- Daily diff view ("what changed since yesterday") using `public/history` snapshots.

## Later
- Browser notifications when relevant raid/event/rocket targets appear.
- Event detail summaries with short human-readable highlights.
- Additional share state parameters (selected Pokemon and advanced filters).

## Notes
- History snapshots are generated by GitHub Actions and pruned to a 7-day window.
- Shared links can carry the full lucky dex state via compressed bitset (`dex` query param).
